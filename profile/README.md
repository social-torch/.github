# A Better Way to Connect Citizens to City Services

## The Issue

Municipalities around the world are responsible for providing services to residents. In the event of an emergency, the average taxpayer knows to contact emergency services by calling 911. However, citizens are less aware of how to report a non-emergency issue, such as a pothole, graffiti, street light out or trash collection issue. Some citizens call 911 to report such matters, unnecessarily overwhelming police departments with non-emergency issues. Others know to dial 311, but callers often face long wait times and the cumbersome task of communicating details and locations over the phone. Too often, citizens see and continue to see issues, yet take no action. City governments lack data on where problems are and how to best deploy their resources. Further, residents lack fact-based metrics to hold municipalities accountable.

## A Solution

To address this issue, ["Open311"](https://federation.data.gov/open311/) was introduced. Open311 first began with an API for Washington D.C.’s 311 system, but it really became a community when the leadership of San Francisco and the support of organizations like OpenPlans, Code for America, and even the White House brought many cities, companies, and organizations together into a productive collaboration. Now it’s a rich ecosystem of cities, technology platforms, and forward thinking initiatives around the world that are building toward a common infrastructure for people to better engage with their government and get connected to their community.

Social Torch builds on this initiative and implements a solution on Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies to cost-effectively deploy web services. Further, Social Torch provides a mobile app for citizens to report issues by snapping a picture with their smartphone, which automatically records the location. Cities can access a secure application that aggregates and prioritizes requests, dispatches resources, keeps citizens informed, and collects data to inform future planning. Further, the ultimate customers, the residents, can see and track complaints and apply pressure on city officials to solve the real problems.
